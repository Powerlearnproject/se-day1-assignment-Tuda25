# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning ddefining project scope objectives and feasibility
Requirement analysis gathering and anaalyzing user needs
Design creating system achitecture and design specifications
Implementation coding writing and compiling the code
Testing ensure that the software functions correctly
Deployment releasing the software for use
Maintenance

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall is Linear sequential while agile is iterative incremental
Waterfall has a rigid structure while agile is highly adaptable
Waterfall has late stag e testing in terms of feedback while agile gives continous feedback

Examples
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer
designs writes and maintains codes
implements new features and fixes bugs
collaborates with team members on software achitectural design

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTS. Tools like visual studio code provide code editing debugging and automation features to enhance productivity
Versal control systems tools like git and subversin help track changes facilitate collaboration and maintain code integrity

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines Use- Agile methodologies for better adaptability
Managing comlexities-apply modular and object orientated programmes
keeping up with technologies -Engage in continous learning training
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing for testing individual components for functionality
Integration testing Ensuring diferent modules work together correctly
System testing Evaluating the entire systems behavior
acceptance testing Verifying software meets user requirement before deployment
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Promt engineering is the practice of designing and refining inputs to AImodels to achieve most relevant and useful response.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt Tell me about history
improved promp provide a brief summary of the course of world war 1
